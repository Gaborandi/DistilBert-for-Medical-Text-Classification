# DistilBert-for-Medical-Text-Classification
DistilBert is finetuned on pubmed data and used for text classification

in this totturial , i used a clead data from pubmed includes medical text about Hepatits

the labels indicates either it includes hepatitis information so it would be 1 or not so it would be 0

DistilBert is very lighth in comparision to Bert model, it doesn't need much power from your device to run 

accuracy could be measuered by different ways, it depends on the data you use (balanced or not, number of labels, etc...)

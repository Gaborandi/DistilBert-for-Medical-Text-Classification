# DistilBert-for-Medical-Text-Classification

distilbert is smaller version of BERT model

this DistilBert model is finetuned on pubmed data and used for text classification. 

in this tutorial , i used a clean data from pubmed includes medical text about Hepatits

the labels indicates either it includes hepatitis information so it would be 1 or not so it would be 0

DistilBert is very lighth in comparision to Bert model, it doesn't need much computational power from your device to run 

accuracy could be measuered by different ways, it depends on the data you use (balanced or not, number of labels, etc...)
